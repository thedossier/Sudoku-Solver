# Sudoku-Solver
# Sudoku Solver created for my girlfriend who loves Sudoku but refuses to use it &lt;3

Simple sudoku solver made for my girlfriend, even though she will not use it. Something about "that ruins all the fun".

Really fun project, I would like to create a GUI for it so it's easier to utilize than having to input numbers manually into the grid in the python file.
